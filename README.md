### Performance Based Engineering Application ###

PBE is an open-source research application that can be used to assess the performance of a building in an earthquake scenario. The application focuses on quantifying building performance through decision variables. The user can characterize the structural model, the damage and loss model, and the seismic hazard model in this application. All models are interconnected by an uncertainty quantification framework that allows the user to define a flexible stochastic model for the problem. Given the stochastic model, the application first performs nonlinear response history simulations to get the Engineering Demand Parameters (EDPs) that describe structural response. Then, those EDPs are used to assess the Damage Measures (DMs) and Decision Variables (DVs) that characterize structural performance.
